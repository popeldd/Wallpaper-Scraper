# Wallpaper Scraper

*** always needs more tweaking :P ***
Note: July 14th, 2020 - Fixed Resolutions and Support for multiple images

Why would you want to waste time trying to find a wallpaper? You can waste just as much time making a simple program to do that for you!
Welp, I did just that! Now thats even less steps for you to take!
This quickly made, all-in-one, terminal app, drastically cuts your wallpaper browsing/selection process down to less than a 30 seconds.

# Current Program Instructions:
1. Parse website for images (unsplash.com)
2. Create a temporary directory to save images
3. Find all images from the correct server (*I need to find a better way to find all img srcs with values starting with x)
3. Download all images at their original resolution
5. Set os specific wallpaper to a randomly selected downloaded image
6. Remove the temporary directory and all of its contents
